  description: |
    Aurora is a machine learning model that can predict atmospheric variables, such as temperature.
    It is a foundation model, which means that it was first generally trained on a lot of data,
    and then can be adapted to specialised atmospheric forecasting tasks with relatively little data.
    Three such specialised versions are provided: one for medium-resolution weather prediction,
    one for high-resolution weather prediction, and one for air pollution prediction.
